# Building a Network

We've talked through a lot of items, considerations, and use cases for
having a dedicated network at a BEST Robotics event.  Lets now look at
concretely how this may be achieved.  We'll look at 3 network
architectures.  Its extremely important to understand that, with the
exception of the Gizmo FMS network, these are bespoke and purpose
built for the events and needs that consume them.  Network engineering
is not a one-size-fits-all process, and carefully documenting your
requirements and approach to solving those requirements are the first
steps to success.

Keep this in mind as you review each of the following examples, and
review these examples more as ideas than concrete implementations you
should try to duplicate.
