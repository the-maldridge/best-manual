## Streaming Your Event

Streaming your event can add an exciting new angle for participants
who can't be present in the room.  This expands the reach of BEST to
grandparents, working parents, and other interested members of the
public who are unable to physically attend.

Streaming your event is not hard, but does take some consideration.

## Streaming Computers

Streaming your event requires at least one computer.  A mini-PC like
an HP EliteDesk is a good choice for this use case, and will provide a
quick and easy way to get started.  The computer will need at least
one monitor though two displays makes it easier to see what you're
doing.

## Streaming Software

The software of choice for streaming is Open Broadcast Studio (OBS).
OBS is a free program that composites various media sources such as
cameras, static graphics, and live information feeds into a single
video feed to be streamed out to external consumers such as YouTube,
TwitchTV, and Facebook Live.

OBS has two screens, a configuration and management screen, and the
multiview that shows you what every source is currently displaying.
