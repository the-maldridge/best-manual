# Stream Encoders

To stream video from a camera to the internet, you will need to encode
it into an appropriate format.  This is almost always done by a
computer, though it can be sepcialized hardware such as a BlackMagic
Streaming Encoder.  In either case, the encoder will be what defines
the maximum resolution and frame-rate you can stream.  An encoder in
modern video systems will usually be integrated into a video switcher,
though it need not be.
