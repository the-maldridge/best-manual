# Introduction

Welcome to my manual for doing things at robotics competitions.  I've
been running IT and operational logistics for robotics competitions
for over a decade now, and this manual contains the collected wisdom
I've learned the hard way.

Note that this manual outlines workflows that I've found work for me,
but that you may need to make adjustments to anything you learn here
to make them work for you.  Also keep in mind that you're reading here
about the refined outcoe of many years getting things wrong, so expect
that you'll need to do some trial and error and optimizing to suit
your own workflows and processes.
